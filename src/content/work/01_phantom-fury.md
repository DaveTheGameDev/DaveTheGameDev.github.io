# My Contributions

I joined during the vertical slice, with a focus on interaction and combat.
I implemented the majority of the weapon and upgrade related functionality, whilst being asked to move between many different systems, implementing whatever was required at the time.

***A list of notable features I worked on.***

## Weapon System
- Developed the core weapon system functionality for projectiles and throwable weapons
- Developed a projectile system that allowed designers to implement unique effects such as plasma blasts and bouncy projectiles
- Implementation of the weapon upgrade system that are purchased from the Kiosks

## Player
- Implemented the player upgrade system and all the individual upgrade functionality avaliable in the Kiosk
- Implemented the Magnetic Shield and Punch arm functionality
- Implemented the players inventory system, including assisting the UI designer with UMG related functionality

## Interactive Elements
- Implemented the interactive terminal system that allowed designers to seamlessly script and control the flow of the game
- Implemented my favourite feature, the old school keypad requiring the player to physically interact to input the code
- Collaborated with the design team to create level specific gameplay elements such as the bowling bomb targeting certain triggers to progress gameplay

## QA
- Supported the team with bug fixing and optimisations by directly working with the QA team to find and squash any issues we came across
