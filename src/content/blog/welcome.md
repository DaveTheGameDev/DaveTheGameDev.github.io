# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by! I have redesigned my website to allow myself to post about things I find interesting in regards to the game development world.

My goal is to post something at least once a month about the projects I have in development, such as my little tribe game, or my core project Plagued.

I needed something short to test things are working as intended, so thanks for the visit.

P.S. *Reinventing the wheel is worth the effort! Don't let people control what you can accomplish.*
